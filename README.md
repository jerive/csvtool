This tool is intended to be used on the command line.
To install it, install composer first.

```shell
composer global require jerive/csvtool dev-master
```

You can still install csvtool locally with composer.
Just add the following to your `composer.json`file:

```json
    {
        "require": {
            "jerive/csvtool": "dev-master"
        }
    }
```
